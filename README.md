# Airbnb_Data_Science

This analysis centered on analyzing Airbnb data for the city of Los Angeles. Using data sourced from public Airbnb data, the aim was to try to understand the dynamics of both rental pricing, host ratings, and the interactions of the two. Ultimately classification strategies were used to predict hostsâ€™ "superhost" status, as well as categorizing their overall rating between high and low. Regression strategies were used to estimate pricing based on both listing features/amenities, host reviews/ratings, as well as location.
